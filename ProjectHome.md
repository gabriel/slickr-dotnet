This hasn't been worked on in a long while, and isn't actively supported; but hopefully by giving out all the source you can hack on it or take what you want from it.

Also, while it uses a couple Mono libraries, I never could get it to compile in Mono. It was never my intention to make Windows only software but thats how it rolled.
